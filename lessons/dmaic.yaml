title: DMAIC
description: Learn the DMAIC methodology in five steps
steps:
  - name: Define (1/5)
    goals:
      - State the problem clearly with scope, impact, and stakeholders
      - Identify CTQs (Critical to Quality) and Voice of Customer
      - Draft a clear project charter
    best_practices:
      - Write a measurable problem statement with baseline and target
      - Keep scope tight to avoid gold-plating
      - List stakeholders and obtain alignment
    prompts_for_user:
      - "Write your one-sentence problem statement (who, what, impact)."
      - "List 3 stakeholders and their needs."
  - name: Measure (2/5)
    goals:
      - Establish baseline metrics and data collection plan
      - Validate measurement system
      - Define operational definitions
    best_practices:
      - Use a simple data dictionary (field, source, owner)
      - Ensure data quality checks are in place
      - Collect enough samples to represent variation
    prompts_for_user:
      - "List 2â€“3 key metrics with current baseline values."
      - "Describe how you will collect data and how often."
  - name: Analyze (3/5)
    goals:
      - Identify root causes and contributing factors
      - Use graphical/analytical tools to explore variation
      - Prioritize causes for action
    best_practices:
      - Use Pareto thinking (vital few vs trivial many)
      - Validate causes with data, not opinion
      - Document assumptions and unknowns
    prompts_for_user:
      - "List suspected root causes and why you think they matter."
      - "What data or evidence supports each?"
  - name: Improve (4/5)
    goals:
      - Generate and test countermeasures
      - Run pilots and evaluate impact on metrics
      - Address risks and change management
    best_practices:
      - Pilot small, learn fast, iterate
      - Involve process owners early
      - Define acceptance criteria before the test
    prompts_for_user:
      - "Describe your top improvement idea and how you will pilot it."
      - "What risks might derail it, and how will you mitigate them?"
  - name: Control (5/5)
    goals:
      - Lock in gains with SOPs, training, and dashboards
      - Define monitoring and response plans
      - Handoff ownership
    best_practices:
      - Create a simple control plan (metric, threshold, owner, action)
      - Document the new standard work
      - Schedule audits or health checks
    prompts_for_user:
      - "Describe your control plan: metric, threshold, owner, action."
      - "What training or documentation is needed?"
